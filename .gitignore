You have "*.pidb.meta" but I don't think that matches any files in my unity project. Shouldn't it just be "*.meta" or should I actually commit some meta files?

You absolutely do need to commit .meta files!

As mentioned in this comment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpXxcvS-g3g&lc=UgymTHStHTb7DKyayRR4AaABAg

You probably want to revise the .gitignore change. The removal of the starting slash will match any folder with those names absolutely anywhere, and that is not what you want. So either (A) "/*/[Ll]ibrary/" or - for this specific case and more accurately in general - (B) use "/Example Game Project/[Ll]ibrary/", where "Example Game Project" is of course replaced by the name of the folder, you are using. Additionally, I'll recommend always naming this very folder simply "Unity". The repository name and README.md file should contain the necessary information for your project. This also means you can largely copy the same .gitignore between different Unity projects.

I.e.:

Rename folder "Example Game Project" to "Unity" (mv Example\ Game\ Project Unity).
Change corresponding lines in .gitignore to:
/Unity/[Aa]ssets/AssetStoreTools*
/Unity/[Bb]uild/
/Unity/[Ll]ibrary/
/Unity/[Ll]ocal[Cc]ache/
/Unity/[Oo]bj/
/Unity/[Tt]emp/
/Unity/[Uu]nityGenerated/
